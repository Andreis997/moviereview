In this project we are going to develop a web application were users can read professional reviews about movies. 
The application has an Admin that rules the page and can delete reviews, users that read reviews(to be complicated more), and the information about movies will be crowled. 
A review consist of a uploaded photo of the movie, comments about the actors and the actual review of the movie and a rating all crawled.
 And then there are different users that have accounts on the site and read the reviews and can also subscribe to a category ( Comedy movies for example) and be notified when a new review from that particular category appears.
